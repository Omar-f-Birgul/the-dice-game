A web site which made with html, css and javascript. I found the chance of practicing javascript and DOM manipulation while I was doing this web site under the guidance of Dr. Angela Yu.
It's a simple web site for rolling dice. There are two players who roll the dice with refreshing the site. The player who rolls the dice big is the winner. If there is a tie, they draw. That's it, time to roll the dice ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²
